#+TITLE: Toki

Toki is a command-line project manager for C and assembly.
It sets up a project structure with a makefile, source folder, and Git repository
with optional nix flakes support. It can build, run and debug projects with simple commands.

* DISCLAIMER
This tool is a work in progress and is mainly for my own personal use. This was made as a learning exercise.

* Usage

#+begin_src bash
toki new projectname  - creates new projects ( new -a for assembly project )
toki build            - builds the project using the Makefile
toki run              - runs the project using make
toki clean            - cleans up the obj and binary files from build folder
toki debug            - opens gdb for debugging
toki gen              - generate a flake.nix or Makefile
#+end_src
